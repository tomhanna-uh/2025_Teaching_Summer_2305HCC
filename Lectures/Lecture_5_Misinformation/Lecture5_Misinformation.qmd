- Misinformation: false or misleading information that is **unknowingly** shared

        - Someone shares a meme that they think is true, but it is false

        - Someone shares a news story that is false, perhaps purposely planted
        - Someone misinterprets satire and shares it as fact

                - Planted false news stories
                - Out of context: missing surrounding words and circumstances, real meaning may be the opposite
                - Unusual definitions: different meaning than normal speech of the *information consumer*

## 55% of Budget for Defense

![55percent_defense meme](55percent_defense.jpg)

## 55% of Budget for Defense

- This meme is disinformation with a footnote
- The number is for the "discretionary" budget, which is only about 27% of the budget
- Does not include state and local spending, which is about 45% of government spending
- There is virtually zero defense spending in the nondiscretionary budget 


## The real number

- 55% x 27% = 15% of the total federal budget

- 15% x 55% = 8.25% of total government spending

- Nondiscretionary and state/local defense spending may add a few percent so

- **Defense: 8.25% to 10%** of total government spending

- **Everything else: 90 to 91.75%** of total government spending




## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

![Tax Dollars Meme](tax_dollars_meme.jpg)


## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
This meme doesn't even have the footnote!
:::

- Doesn't say that this is discretionary spending
- Doesn't give a source


## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
If I told you that there is virtually no nondiscretionary defense spending, what would the picture look like if we did the same thing for the nondiscretionary budget?
:::


## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

![Where our tax dollars go](Design.png)

Note - this is a hypothetical, AI generated using Copilot and not accurate


## Unusual Definitions/Lack of Context

- These memes **purposely** confuse two different things

Simple definitions:

                - Discretionary: set in every budget
                - Nondiscretionary: set far in advance
                - Total budget: Discretionary plus Nondiscretionary
                
- This shows only discretionary spending

                - Most spending on the little categories is nondiscretionary
                - Virtually all defense spending is discretionary

- If we show the total budget, the picture changes drastically
- If we show only nondiscretionary, the rocket disappears

## Why is this a problem?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
Suppose you believe the United States should spend less on defense and more on these other priorities, what is wrong with these memes?
:::



## Why is this a problem?

"This week on Facebook I ran into a couple of memes about the defense budget that I thought were worth addressing. While the **core message that the United States spends too much on the military is sound**, these particular memes are so **massively misleading** that I think it would be irresponsible to let them go unanswered..."

## Why is this a problem?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 60px;"}
Suppose you believe the United States should provide college for free like Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, or Norway, what is wrong with these memes portrayal of
education spending? Spending is the problem, right?
:::


## Why is this a problem?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 60px;"}
"Our education spending is about average (though somehow we do it so inefficiently that we don’t provide college for free, unlike Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, or Norway)...How about a meme about that?"

                - Does the dishonest information distract from real root causes?

## Just to be clear

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 50px;"}
The two examples are obvious, easily refuted, egregious examples from the left. This isn't limited by party or ideology.

<!-- ## Healthcare, Climate Change: Important Issues! -->



<!-- “We have a planetary crisis in terms of climate change. Our health care system is broken and dysfunctional. Our educational system is teetering. Our housing stock is totally inadequate. And these are just some of the crises facing our country,” [Senator Bernie Sanders] said. -->

<!-- - **Mostly true. A little exaggeration, but deserves discussion!** -->

<!-- - **How do you want to argue for these issues effectively?** -->

<!-- - **If you disagree, how do you want to respond?** -->

# Social Spending: Is this true?

Based on the budget, this isn't true at least for federal spending. 

Not based on private charitable spending *as a percent of national income* either [List of countries by charitable spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_charitable_donation_as_percentage_of_GDP)

“It just happens,” [Senator Bernie Sanders] said. “We don’t worry about people sleeping out on the street...”

## Election Budget vs Healthcare Spending

                d - veteran's benefits - 4%
                
## Election Budget vs Healthcare Spending

TRUE MEME: We already spend $1,398 billion on healthcare. How much difference would $2 billion more make?

RESPONSE MEME: If free healthcare only cost $6.06 per person, why does it even need to be free? I'll pay for mine and 100 other people and still save money!
