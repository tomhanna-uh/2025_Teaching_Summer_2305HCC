## Agenda Today

- Lecture: The Bill of Rights as the foundation of Civil Liberties
        
- Discussion/Activity: Memes
        
- Module 2 Quiz






## Review

- American philosophy: government exists for protection of individual rights **from violence**
- Strong central government itself has huge **power** for coercive use of force/violence 
- Separation of Powers, Checks and Balances, Federalism created to restrain federal government power 
- The Anti-federalists wanted more protection than just limiting the government to certain enumerated powers (specific listed powers)...

## First Amendment: Free exercise

 - Free exercise of religion
 
- Citizens practice faith according to their conscience
- Engage in religious rituals (or don't)
- Adopt a faith of their choosing (or don't)<sup>1</sup>
                
<p style="font-size: x-large">1 - In this respect, the  No Establishment Clause doesn't conflict, it reinforces.</p>
 
## First Amendment: Not present

Not present in the Constitution or First Amendment:

- The phrase "Separation of Church and State"
- The phrase "Wall of separation between church and state"

Important questions:

- Should either phrase be added?
- What relations between church and state should be allowed?
                
 
## Second Amendment: Right to bear arms, independent state militias
 
Constitution of the United States: Second Amendment
 
 - "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
 
 
## Second Amendment: A power and a right

- There are two clauses (with unneeded commas)
- Clause 1 *implies* a state power - the power to have an independent militia to secure the state's freedom
- Clause 1 explains one reason the second is desirable
- Clause 2 grants a right  - the right to bear arms
- Clause 2 specifies the people hold the right


## Second Amendment: Questions

- **Does disagreement about the explanation (militia) negate the right of the people?**
- *What does well regulated mean?*<sup>1</sup>
                
<p style="font-size: x-large">1 - Supreme Court Justices have argued about these since at least the 1920s: We can disagree. These are points for thought. </p>


                
## Third Amendment: Quartering of Soldiers

Constitution of the United States: Third Amendment 

- "No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law."
- This hasn't come up in a long time
