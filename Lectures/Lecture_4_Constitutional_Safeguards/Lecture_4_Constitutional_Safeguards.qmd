# Today's Topic: Separation of Powers, Federalism, Checks and Balances

## Review

- Basic problem: Government is organized coercive violence seen as legitimate

        - Great power to do good consensually where we are largely unified
        - Great power to do bad if resort to corecive violence is necessary because there is not wide agreement


## Why do we care about the Constitution

- The Constitution set out a system to limit the power of government to allow for the good and limit the bad

- If we just pretend to follow it, it has no real power to limit oppression - political violence

- The Constitution has been changed, in some ways drastically to deal with some of its original flaws

- There is a process to change it further if there is unity in the desire for change, but fundamental rights are not up to simple majorities


## How did the Constitutional design limit abuse of power

- Separation of Powers within the federal government
- Checks and balances between individuals groups in the federal government
- Federalism: separation of powers between levels of government - state/federal
- The addition of the Bill of Rights (First 10 Amendments)
