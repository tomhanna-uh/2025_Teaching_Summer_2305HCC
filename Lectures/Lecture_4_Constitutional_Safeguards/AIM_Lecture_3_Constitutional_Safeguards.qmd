# Today's Topic: Separation of Powers, Federalism, Checks and Balances

## Review

- Basic problem: Government is organized coercive violence seen as legitimate

        - Great power to do good consensually where we are largely unified
        - Great power to do bad if resort to corecive violence is necessary because there is not wide agreement


## Why do we care about the Constitution? 

- This applies to any Constitution intended to limit government power

- The Constitution set out a system to limit the power of government to allow for the good and limit the bad

- If we just pretend to follow it, it has no real power to limit oppression - political violence

- The Constitution has been changed, in some ways drastically to deal with some of its original flaws

- There is a process to change it further if there is unity in the desire for change, but fundamental rights are not up to simple majorities


## How did the Constitutional design limit abuse of power

- Separation of Powers within the federal government
- Checks and balances between individuals groups in the federal government
- Federalism: separation of powers between levels of government - state/federal
- The addition of the Bill of Rights (First 10 Amendments)



## Separation of Powers

## Separation of Powers


> The Constitution was devised with an ingenious and  intricate built-in system of checks and balances to guard  the people’s liberty against combinations of government  power.

This is especially true when we consider the evolved Constitution  including the Bill of Rights plus 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, and 26th  amendments

## Checks and Balances

## Splitting up power to prevent abuse
