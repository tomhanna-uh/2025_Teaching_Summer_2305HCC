# Create the table above using kableExtra in R Studio Quarto
sanctions_data <- data.frame(
  Sanction = c("Expulsion", "Censure", "Reprimand", "Fine", "Other", "Referral to authorities"),
  Description = c(
    "Removal from office",
    "Formal disapproval",
    "Official rebuke",
    "Monetary penalty",
    "Denial of privileges, etc.",
    "Referral to federal or state authorities for potential legal action"
  ),
  "House/Senate" = c("Both", "Both", "Both", "Both", "Both", "Both")
)

kable(sanctions_data, format = "html", caption = "Types of Sanctions") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
  

```
  

## Comparison to private trustees {.smaller}


```{r}
# Create the table using kableExtra in R Studio Quarto
library(kableExtra)

fiduciary_data <- data.frame(
  Duty = c("Duty of Loyalty", "Duty of Care", "Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing", "Duty of Confidentiality", "Full Disclosure","Record Keeping","Informing Clients"),
  "House of Representatives" = c(
    "No business with the federal government inconsistent with duties ", 
    "Protect public trust in office", 
    "No applicable rule", 
    "Confidentiality of investigation information", 
    "No business with the federal government inconsistent with duties","No rule","No rule"
  ),
  Senate = c(
    "Place loyalty above private gain", 
    "Latitude in ethics rules", 
    "No applicable rule", 
    "Confidentiality of reported information", 
    "Financial Disclosure Reports required","No rule","No rule"
  )
)

kable(fiduciary_data, format = "html", caption = "Fiduciary Responsibilities and Ethical Standards") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```


## Comparison to private trustees 

- Record Keeping - no rule

- Informing clients (the people) - no rule

        - Note that there is also no ethical or other standard requiring that Congressional committees hold open public meetings
        - This includes the Ethics Committee which typically holds only closed meetings

Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) and former first term Chief of Staff to President Donald Trump, stated regarding his office's policy while in the House, “We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress.

If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.”^[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/mulvaney-consumer-financial-protection-bureau.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur]
