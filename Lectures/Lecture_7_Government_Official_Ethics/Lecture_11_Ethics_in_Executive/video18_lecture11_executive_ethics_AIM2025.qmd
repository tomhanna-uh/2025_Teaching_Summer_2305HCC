# The President and Vice-President

## 18 U.S.C. § 208

- 18 U.S.C. § 208 is the primary federal conflict of interest statute 


## 18 U.S.C. § 208

- 18 U.S.C. § 208 is the primary federal conflict of interest statute

- the President and Vice-President are specifically *exempt* from 18 U.S.C. § 208




## Presidential Exemption

- Subjecting the President and Vice-President to the Courts in this way could interfere with their Constitutional duties.


## Presidential Exemption

- Subjecting the President and Vice-President to the Courts in this way could interfere with their Constitutional duties.

- Giving the Courts an additional, extra-Constitutional power would upset the carefully crafted Constitutional Balance of Powers.

## Presidential Exemption

- Subjecting the President and Vice-President to the Courts in this way could interfere with their Constitutional duties.

- Giving the Courts an additional, extra-Constitutional power would upset the carefully crafted Constitutional Balance of Powers.

- The Constitution provides an enforcement mechanism as part of its system of Checks and Balances - 


## Impeachment

>The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.


## Impeachment

- Congress may investigate the President and Vice-President under the impeachment power
- Congress has the power to subpoena witnesses and Presidential records
- Courts will enforce Congressional subpoenas, up to and including imprisoning those who do not comply



## Terms

- Impeachment - a list of charges, similar to an indictment or information in a criminal trial
- Conviction - 2/3 of US Senators voting that the person is guilty of the impeachment charges after a trial in the US Senate
- Treason is specifically defined in the Constitution
- Bribery is not defined in the C., but is accepting something of value in exchange for some official favor
- high crimes and Misdemeanors: not specifically defined


## High crimes and misdemeanors

- Crimes of corruption that threaten the system of government

- Not all crimes and misdemeanors meet this

- These do not actually need to be crimes and misdemeanors defined by statutes


## Example 1

- President and others are having a poker game, one accuses the President of cheating, and the President punches him? 

- Gambling may be illegal in some areas.
- Assault is illegal.

Is this a "high crime or misdemeanor"?


## Example 2

- The President wants the Vice-President to break a tie in the Senate and the Vice-President refuses. The President leaks private information to the press about the Vice-President that results in his resignation?

- Releasing true information to the press is generally not illegal.
- The Vice-Presidential power to break ties is an independent Constitutional power that belongs solely to the Vice-President.

- Is this a "high crime or misdemeanor"?

## Impeachment consequences

> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.


## Impeachment consequences

- Removal from office (automatic)
- Disqualification from future office (optional)

## Key issues

- Extreme partisan polarization 

        - political impeachments
        - political acquittals
        
- Limited consequences

        - Presidential immunity from prosecution in the Court for official acts (Trump v. United States 2024)
        
- Lack of clear definitions other than Treason^[Even the valid definition of Treason is widely unknown or disregarded by the public.]
