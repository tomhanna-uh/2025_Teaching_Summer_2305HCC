## Taxpayer's Persepective

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
Everyone in this class could figure this out today with the link to the IRS website using long hand math on paper, if you had to!
:::


## Taxpayer's Perspective

- Withholding
- W4, W2, 1040, 1099
- Gross Income, Adjusted Gross Income, Taxable Income
- Tax Brackets
- Tax Credits vs. Tax Deductions
- Standard Deduction vs. Itemized Deductions
- Paying your taxes: Tax software & Tax professionals


## Paying Your Taxes: Process

- Withholding 

        - W4 sets withholding amount from paycheck

        
- Filing the return

        - W2 shows information withholding
        - 1099 shows income from other sources
        - 1040 series are tax return forms
        - Gross Income: Total received
        - Adjusted Gross Income: Gross income minus adjustments
        - Taxable Income: AGI minus deductions
        
## Credits and Deductions

- Credits

        - dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability
        - May be a percentage
        - refundable or nonrefundable
        - Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit
        
- Deductions

        - commonly called "write-offs"
        - reduces taxable income
        - reduces tax liability by the tax rate x deduction (less than 100%)
        
## Deduction Example

![Income Tax Rates](brackets2025.png){#income_tax_rates .class .class2}

## Deduction Example

- Tax Rate: 22%
- Deduction Amount: $10,000
- Tax Liability Reduction: $10,000 x 22% = $2,200
- Tax Paid after deduction: $10,000 - $2,200 = $7,800


        
## You can't make money from "write-offs"

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
It is mathematically impossible to make money from a deduction or a credit of less than 100%
:::



## Standard vs. Itemized Deductions

:::{.custom-style style="font-size: 80px;"}
You have to pick one or the other. No, you can't have both.
:::
        
        
## Standard vs. Itemized Deductions

Source: [Money Guy](https://moneyguy.com/article/the-irs-just-announced-2025-tax-changes/)

## Standard vs. Itemized Deductions

- Itemized deductions
        
        - Add up the deductions
        - Must be allowable deductions
        - Examples: mortgage interest, medical expenses over 7.5% of AGI, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, unreimbursed business expenses
        - Must be more than the standard deduction to be worth it
        - Auditable
