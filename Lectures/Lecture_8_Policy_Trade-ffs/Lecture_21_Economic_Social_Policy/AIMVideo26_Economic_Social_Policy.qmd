# Economic, Social and Environmental Policy: Collective Action Problems, Trade-offs, and Choices





## Why Public Policy is Necessary: Collective Action Problems

- Collective Action Problems: Individuals would benefit from cooperating but incentives not to cooperate are stronger

- Collective Action Problems: lack of information, coordination, or trust among individuals.



## Is government action the only solution?

- Markets actually solve far more collective action problems than government

        - Existing markets
        - Privatization of government enterprises

- Private governance structures - polycentric governance


## Collective action problems and Market Failures


- Externalities
- Free rider problems
- Tragedy of the Commons 


## Externalities

## Positive Externalities

## Externalities Problem 

- Negative externalities: *overproduction* because the cost is not included in the price
- Positive externalities: *underproduction* because the benefit is not included in the price

## Potential solutions

- Government solutions to externalities

        - lawsuits - U
        - bureaucratic regulation - E, I, A, P
        - Congressional regulation - E,D, I, p
        - assigning property rights - F,U,P
        - taxes and subsidies - F,E,D
        
- Pros and Cones

        F = Efficient: Those who benefit bear the full cost
        I = inefficient
        E = Equal
        U = Unequal
        D = Democratic
        A = Anti-democratic
        P = politically unpopular

## Solutions to free rider problems

- Easy

        - Accept the free riders
        - Those who want to pay, pay
        
- Government Solutions

        - Taxes
        - User fees, tolls, etc. 
        - Regulation to exclude free riders 

- Private solutions

        - Private governance structures
        - Private contracts
        - Private insurance

## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*


## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*
- benefit vs *cost of enforcement*



## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*
- benefit vs *cost of enforcement*
- *financial costs* of enforcement - just the beginning


## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*
- benefit vs *cost of enforcement*
- *financial costs* of enforcement - just the beginning
- *Human costs of enforcement*

## Judging Public Policy Trade-offs: Short-term vs Long-term Benefits


- Higher spending now vs. Higher taxes later
- More educations spending now vs. economic growth later
- More infrastructure spending now vs. economic growth later
- More regulation now vs. fewer, lower paid jobs later
- More consumption now vs. environmental issues later
- Lower immigration now vs. population decline later
- Higher taxes now vs. slower poverty reduction


## Recap

- Collective action problems and market failures
- Government is not the only solution
- Where government is the solution, trade-offs should be considered carefully including:

        - policy benefits versus individual freedoms and human costs
        - economic and social trade-offs
        - short-term versus long-term benefits
        
- The right solution in every case is to carefully consider all the trade-offs and make the best decision considering all aspects of the problem and potential solutions.
